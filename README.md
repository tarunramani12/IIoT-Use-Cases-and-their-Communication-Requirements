# IIoT-Use-Cases-and-their-Communication-Requirements

## Short Summary
Global changes require industrial actors to operate as eﬃciently as possible to stay compe ve. We
have seen the emergence of concepts like Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing and industrial automa on
as an answer to those requirements. In this work we explored the industries supported by IoT,
namely IIoT, and what communication requirements its development implies.

## Tasks
 Investigate the IIoT vertical in terms of architecture components.
 Identify a typical industrial scenario that may benefit from adopting IoT solutions.
 For that scenario (IIoT use cases) identify and classify their communication requirements (from diﬀerent layers perspective).
